      <h2>Education</h2>
      <p>
        Mandy was born in Nashville, Tennessee where she attended several K-8 schools around the Middle Tennessee area, and completed high school in Lebanon, Tennessee (the home of Cracker Barrel!). After graduating high school in 2004, Mandy attended college at Austin Peay State University in Clarksville, Tennessee to study Physics and Mathematics.

        She quickly realized that she got much more enjoyment out of her music classes and ensembles. After a two-year break from school, she changed her major to Flute Performance and Music Education, and re-enrolled at APSU. Mandy graduated <i>cum laude</i> in December of 2013.
